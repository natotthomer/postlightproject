# Postlight Project -- Employee Directory

I built this project using Django and React. They're the two frameworks I'm most familiar with and I figured I might as well stick to what I know. I used [randomuser.me](randomuser.me) to seed my database. Django acts both webserver and API server.

Features include:

-Update and Delete Employee functions
-Pagination
-Sorting
-Search
-React Router for frontend routing
-CSS animations for messaging
-simple API

## To Install
